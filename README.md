A simple skeleton SCM plugin for Jenkins
====

##Note
At this time I have stopped using Gradle to build Jenkins plugins because I find it slower than maven.
It also seems the maven way of writing plugins has more advanced features, like findbugs and coverage.

## About this project
This plugin is a simple skeleton of an SCM plugin for [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org),
that you can build using Gradle 2.9, or maven.

This work is based on two tutorials:

1. https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Writing+an+SCM+plugin
2. https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-jpi-plugin

# Usage

See the [Gradle JPI Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-jpi-plugin)
